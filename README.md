<h2>Tutorial Descriptions</h2>

<h4>Part 1 - Introduction and Installation</h4>
<p>Bootstrap is the most popular front-end framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. In our first tutorial, we show you how to install Bootstrap.</p>

<h4>Part 2 - Responsive NavBar with Dropdown Menus</h4>
<p>We build a responsive navbar with dropdown menus that is optimized for mobile devices. Navbars are responsive meta components that serve as navigation headers for your application or site. They begin collapsed (and are toggleable) in mobile views and become horizontal as the available viewport width increases. </p>

<h4>Part 3 - Fixed Footer</h4>
<p>We build a fixed footer navbar. Navbars are responsive meta components that serve as navigation headers for your application or site. They begin collapsed (and are toggleable) in mobile views and become horizontal as the available viewport width increases.</p>

<h4>Part 4 - Font Awesome & Social Icons</h4>
<p>We show you how to install Font Awesome and how to add social icons to your website's footer. Font Awesome gives you scalable vector icons that can instantly be customized â€” size, color, drop shadow, and anything that can be done with the power of CSS. </p>

<h4>Part 5 - Jumbotron</h4>
<p>We show you how to build a jumbotron and make important content on your website really standaout. A jumbotron is a A lightweight, flexible component that can optionally extend the entire viewport to showcase key content on your site.</p>

<h4>Part 6 - Grid System</h4>
<p>We explain the Bootstrap grid system and show you how to add columns of text to your website that collapse appropriately. Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases. It includes predefined classes for easy layout options, as well as powerful mixins for generating more semantic layouts.</p>

<h4>Part 7 - Modal</h4>
<p>We build a modal (pop-up box) for the website. Modals are streamlined, but flexible, dialog prompts with the minimum required functionality and smart defaults.</p>
